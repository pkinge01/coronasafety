          Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,
          especially after being in a public place, or after blowing your nose,
          coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, use a hand
          sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

          The virus is thought to be spread mainly from person-to-person. Avoid
          close contact with people who are sick, and practice social distancing
          by keeping at least 6 feet away from others when you are in public
          place.

          It may spread between people through respiratory droplets when an
          infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the
          mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into
          the lungs. Wear a mask to cover your mouth and nose when around others
          when you are out in public.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and
          throw the tissue away after use. If a tissue isnâ€™t available, cough or
          sneeze into your elbow or sleeve, not your hands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes
          tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, computers, phones,
